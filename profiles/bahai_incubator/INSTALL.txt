PREREQUISITES
=============

To install the Incubator profile you will need the following:

1. A server with filesystem access
2. A running web server, such as Apache or Nginx
3. A running database server, such as MySQL, and a database for each website
4. A domain or subdomain at which to access each site

You will need to point the domain you are using to the folder that contains the
incubator's Drupal installation, and create a database for your new website.
Different web hosts have different control panels, so you will have to figure
those steps out yourself.

MANUAL INSTALLATION
===================

Download the Incubator from http://drupal.org/project/bahai_incubator and copy
all the files to your server.

Owing to legal and technical issues, there are some code libraries which cannot
be included in a Drupal distribution.  The Incubator uses four such libraries,
listed below.  If you are using the manual installation method, you should
download each of these libraries and copy them to the locations indicated within
your Incubator installation.

- CKEditor
  download from http://download.cksource.com/CKEditor/CKEditor/CKEditor%203.6.1/ckeditor_3.6.1.tar.gz
  copy to /path/to/drupal/profiles/bahai_incubator/libraries/ckeditor

- Colorbox
  download from http://jacklmoore.com/colorbox/colorbox.zip
  copy to /path/to/drupal/profiles/bahai_incubator/libraries/colorbox

- fullcalendar
  download from http://arshaw.com/fullcalendar/downloads/fullcalendar-1.5.2.zip
  copy to /path/to/drupal/profiles/bahai_incubator/libraries/fullcalendar
  (you should remove the demo and source folders.)

After all the files are in their proper places, go to the "site setup" section
below.


INSTALLATION WITH DRUSH MAKE
============================

If you have shell access to the server you may benefit from using two command
line tools for Drupal, Drush (http://drupal.org/project/drush) and Drush Make
(http://drupal.org/project/drush_make).  Once you have installed those tools on
your server, you can create a short makefile to download the Incubator and all
its dependencies with a single command, as follows:

    core = 7.x
    api = 2
    projects[] = drupal
    projects[] = bahai_incubator

Save that file as my_incubator.make, then run the following command in a shell:

    drush make my_incubator.make incubator

This will download everything you need and put it in a new "incubator" folder.
After you have set up the database and web server with your web host, you will
need to go through the "site setup" steps outlined below.


SITE SETUP
==========

When you visit your site for the first time, you may be asked to give Drupal
information about your database.  The step-by-step install script should lead
you through all the general prerequisites for running Drupal.  When asked for
the profile, choose "Baha'i Incubator".

After you log in to the site for the first time, you should change your password
and then continue with site setup.
